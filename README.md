# JS-in-the-Browser
### I used the same index.html from our previous project about accessibility except this time I was going to make it all work with javascript.
## Error and Success
### I chose to put a green and red border around my input when there was a success or error (style.css) and there is also some text that appears below which I added as a string to my setError.
## Success Screen
### My pop up when all the inputs are correct will appear with a picture and a button. I added a oneclick to close the screen.
### See more details in my comments for each code section.
